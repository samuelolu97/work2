Use of Cookies and Tracking
Websites that use cookies or other technologies to obtain personal information from their website's visitors or customers include a cookies clause in their Privacy Policies. Generally, the cookies clause states that the website uses cookies, why it uses them, and how users can disable cookies on their devices.

Canva's Privacy Policy has a section on Cookies information that explains cookies usage.

Canva Privacy Policy: Cookies Information Clause

It says that Canva uses cookies to improve your experience with their website by helping you log in faster and making their on-site navigation better. Cookies are also placed in order to track how you use the website. Canva discloses that its business partners also receive this information. Finally, it's noted that if you disable cookies, some features of Canva might not work properly.

Changes to the Privacy Policy
You will likely have to change the content of your Privacy Policy at some time. For this reason, most Privacy Policies have a clause that states how they will inform users about updates and revisions to the agreement.

Let's take a look at LogMeIn's Privacy Policy again:

This clause states that the Policy may be updated and discloses how notifications of material changes will be given. It also says that if you continue to use the services after the update then you automatically agree to the revised Privacy Policy.

Examples of Websites with Privacy Policies
Regardless of whether you're running a website, web app, mobile app or desktop app, if you're collecting personal information from your end users then you're required to post a Privacy Policy.

Most websites provide a link to their Privacy Policy in their homepage footer, main navigation, or an appropriate sub-menu.

Let's take a look at the Privacy Policy agreements of some popular websites.

Reddit
